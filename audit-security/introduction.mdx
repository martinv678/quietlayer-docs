title: "Audit pack specification"
---

The QuietLayer audit pack provides durable, inspection-ready evidence that a verification was performed correctly at a specific point in time.

It is designed to support internal reviews, third-party audits, and regulatory inspections by presenting a clear, consistent record of:

- what check was performed,
- when it was performed,
- what result was returned, and
- what evidence was captured at that moment.

The audit pack is intended to be human-readable, verifiable, and defensible.


### When an audit pack is generated

An audit pack is generated for each completed verification.

For Right to Work share code checks, this occurs once:

- the share code has been submitted,
- the result has been successfully retrieved, and
- the verification outcome has been recorded.

Each audit pack represents a single, point-in-time verification event.

### Artefacts included

Each audit pack contains the following artefacts.

#### 1. Audit report (PDF)

A structured PDF document that summarises the verification.

The report includes:

- Verification type (e.g. Right to Work share code check)
- Verification outcome (e.g. valid / not valid)
- Date and time of the check (UTC)
- Expiry date of the right to work permission, where applicable
Employer or organisation identifier
QuietLayer verification reference ID

The PDF is designed to be printable, shareable, and suitable for long-term retention.

#### 2. Visual evidence capture

A visual capture of the result page returned during the verification process.

This is included to provide:

- human-readable confirmation of the result,
- visible GOV.UK branding and context, and
- reassurance that the check was performed against the correct service.

The visual evidence reflects what was presented at the time of the check and is not subsequently modified.

#### 3. Verification metadata

Structured metadata associated with the verification, including:

- verification identifiers,
- timestamps,
- verification type,
- outcome status, and
- internal reference IDs.

This metadata supports traceability and reconciliation between systems.

#### 4. Integrity hashes

Cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) are generated for key artefacts, including:

- the audit report,
- the visual evidence capture, and
- the underlying verification record.

These hashes allow consumers of the audit pack to:

- detect accidental corruption,
- identify unauthorised modification, and
- confirm artefact integrity over time.

---

### Integrity and immutability model

QuietLayer applies integrity controls at the time the verification is completed.

In practical terms:

- artefacts are generated once per verification,
- hashes are calculated immediately after generation, and
- the resulting records are treated as immutable.

QuietLayer does not alter or regenerate audit artefacts after completion.
If a new check is required, a new verification and audit pack is created.

This ensures that each audit pack represents a faithful snapshot of a specific verification event.

---

### What is intentionally not included

To reduce risk and avoid unverifiable or misleading artefacts, the audit pack does not include:

- Raw HTML or DOM dumps
- Session cookies or browser state
- Client-side scripts or assets
- Reconstructed or replayed pages
Derived or inferred data not returned by the verification source

Only evidence that can be reasonably reviewed and relied upon is included.

---

### Access and retention

Audit packs are associated with the organisation that performed the verification.

Access is restricted to authorised users and systems.
Retention policies are defined at the organisational level and can be aligned with internal compliance requirements.

QuietLayer does not repurpose audit pack data for unrelated use.

---

### Compliance and responsibility

The audit pack is designed to support compliant processes, not to replace them.

QuietLayer:

- provides evidence and traceability,
- aligns with published guidance, and
- supports audit and inspection workflows.

Final responsibility for compliance decisions remains with the employer or organisation performing the verification.

---

### TLDR;

The QuietLayer audit pack is a first-class compliance artefact.

It is:

- generated automatically,
- structured for review,
- protected by integrity controls, and
- suitable for audits without additional explanation or reconstruction.
