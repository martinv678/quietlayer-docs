---

QuietLayer is a verification and audit layer for UK compliance checks.
It automates verification workflows and produces inspection-ready audit packs that employers can rely on.

QuietLayer exists to remove ambiguity from compliance. Instead of manual screenshots, scattered PDFs, and ad-hoc record keeping. It provides a consistent, verifiable record of what check was performed, when it was performed, and what evidence was captured at the time.


### The problem QuietLayer solves

UK employers are legally required to carry out compliance checks.

In practice, these checks are often:

- Performed manually

- Documented inconsistently

- Stored across multiple systems

- Difficult to audit after the fact

- Easy to get wrong under time pressure

The result is operational risk: missed expiry dates, incomplete evidence, and reliance on human memory during audits.

QuietLayer addresses this by treating verification evidence as a first-class output, not an afterthought.

### What QuietLayer does

QuietLayer provides a structured way to run compliance checks and capture evidence at the moment the check is completed.

Today, QuietLayer:

- Runs a range of UK verifications

- Captures the result and supporting evidence at the time of the check

- Generates a structured audit pack for each verification

- Records timestamps and integrity hashes to protect against tampering

- Centralises verification history for employers and teams

The focus is not automation for its own sake, but durable, reviewable evidence.

### What QuietLayer is not

QuietLayer is intentionally narrow in scope.

It is **not**:

- A recruitment platform

- A background-check marketplace

- A document storage system

- A legal decision-maker

QuietLayer does not replace employer responsibility.
It provides the tooling and evidence needed to meet that responsibility with confidence.


### Who QuietLayer is for

QuietLayer is designed for organisations that run compliance checks as part of their operations, including:

- Employers conducting checks on candidates

- Recruitment agencies handling multiple candidates

- Operations and compliance teams exposed to audits

It is not intended for individuals running one-off checks or for jurisdictions outside the UK.


### How QuietLayer is delivered

QuietLayer is API-first.

This allows organisations to integrate verification directly into their existing workflows while maintaining a consistent evidence and audit model. A hosted interface is available where appropriate, but the underlying system is designed to be embedded, automated, and auditable.

### A note on compliance and responsibility

QuietLayer follows UK guidance and is designed to support compliant processes.
Final responsibility for hiring decisions and compliance outcomes always remains with the employer.

QuietLayer’s role is to make those decisions easier to evidence, review, and defend.
