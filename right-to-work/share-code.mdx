---

## Purpose

QuietLayer’s Right to Work (RTW) share code verification service automates the process of checking an individual’s right to work in the UK using the Home Office share code system.

The service is designed to:
- reduce manual effort,
- standardise evidence capture, and
- produce inspection-ready audit packs that can be relied upon during audits or reviews.

Each verification represents a **single, point-in-time check**.

---

## When RTW share code verification is used

RTW share code verification is used when:

- an individual provides a Home Office share code,
- an employer is required to confirm right to work before employment, and
- durable evidence of the check must be retained.

QuietLayer does not generate share codes.  
It verifies share codes provided by the employer or worker.

---

## Inputs

To perform an RTW share code verification, QuietLayer requires:

- Share code  
- Date of birth  
- Organisational context (the employer performing the check)

No additional personal information is required to run the verification.

---

## Verification process

For each RTW share code verification, QuietLayer performs the following steps:

1. Receives the share code and date of birth  
2. Retrieves the RTW result from the GOV.UK service  
3. Validates and parses the returned result  
4. Captures visual and structured evidence at the time of the check  
5. Records verification metadata and timestamps  
6. Generates an audit pack  

The process is designed to reflect exactly what was returned at the time of verification.

---

## Verification outcome

Each verification results in a clear outcome, including:

- Right to work status  
- Expiry date of permission (where applicable)  
- Verification timestamp (UTC)  
- QuietLayer verification reference ID  

QuietLayer records the outcome but does not make hiring decisions.

---

## Audit pack generation

An audit pack is generated for every completed RTW share code verification.

The audit pack includes:

- A structured audit report (PDF)  
- Visual evidence of the GOV.UK result page  
- Verification metadata and identifiers  
- Cryptographic integrity hashes (SHA-256)  

The audit pack represents a **durable snapshot** of the verification at the time it was performed.

Further detail is available in the Audit Pack Specification.

---

## Integrity and immutability

Integrity controls are applied once the verification is completed:

- Audit artefacts are generated once per verification  
- Cryptographic hashes are calculated immediately  
- Records are treated as immutable  

If a new check is required, a new verification and audit pack must be created.  
Existing records are not modified.

---

## What this service does not do

RTW share code verification does **not**:

- generate or manage share codes  
- make employment or hiring decisions  
- provide legal advice  
- assess suitability beyond the returned RTW status  

QuietLayer supports compliant processes by providing accurate evidence, not judgement.

---

## Data handling

Data used during RTW share code verification is handled in line with QuietLayer’s data handling and integrity principles:

- data minimisation,  
- purpose limitation, and  
- restricted access.

Details are covered in the Data Handling & Integrity documentation.

---

## Employer responsibility

QuietLayer follows published Home Office Right to Work guidance and is designed to support compliant workflows.

Final responsibility for right to work decisions and compliance outcomes remains with the employer performing the verification.

---

## Summary

QuietLayer’s RTW share code verification service provides:

- automated verification against the GOV.UK service,  
- consistent evidence capture, and  
- audit-ready records suitable for inspection.

Each verification produces a clear outcome and a defensible audit trail.
