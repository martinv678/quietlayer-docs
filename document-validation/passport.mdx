QuietLayer’s passport OCR validation service extracts and validates passport data from an uploaded document in order to support identity verification workflows.

It is designed to:

- reduce manual data entry,
- standardise how passport details are captured, and
- produce auditable evidence of what was extracted and validated at a specific point in time.

Passport OCR validation is not a right-to-work determination on its own. It is a supporting verification step that can be combined with other checks.

---

## When passport OCR is used

Passport OCR validation is typically used when:

- a passport image is provided as part of a verification flow,
- structured passport data is required for downstream checks, or
- organisations want consistent, reviewable evidence of what was submitted.

The service operates on a single uploaded document per verification.

---

## Inputs

To perform passport OCR validation, QuietLayer requires:

- An image or scan of a passport document
- The issuing country (where applicable)
-The verification context (organisation and verification reference)

Images are processed only for the purpose of extracting and validating passport data.

---

## What QuietLayer does

For each passport OCR validation, QuietLayer performs the following steps:

1. Accepts the uploaded passport image
2. Extracts machine-readable and visual passport fields using OCR
3. Validates field structure and formats (e.g. dates, document numbers)
4. Records the extracted data and validation results
5. Generates an audit pack for the verification

The focus is on **accurate capture** and traceability, not inference.

---

## Data extracted

Depending on document quality and issuing country, extracted fields may include:

- Full name
- Date of birth
- Passport number
- Issuing country
- Expiry date
- Document type

Extracted fields are returned exactly as read and are not corrected or inferred beyond basic format validation.

---

## Validation performed

Passport OCR validation includes:

- Structural validation of passport fields
- Date validation (e.g. expiry date format and validity)
- Consistency checks between visual and machine-readable zones where available

QuietLayer does not assert document authenticity or legal validity beyond these checks.

--- 

## Outputs

Each completed passport OCR validation produces:

- A structured OCR result (extracted fields and validation status)
- A verification outcome indicating success or failure of extraction
- An audit pack containing:
  - a summary report (PDF),
  - visual evidence of the submitted document,
  - verification metadata, and
  integrity hashes.
  
---

## Audit pack contents

The audit pack for passport OCR validation includes:

- Verification summary and reference ID
- Timestamp of processing (UTC)
- Extracted passport fields
- Validation results
- Visual capture of the submitted document
- Cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) for key artefacts

The audit pack represents a point-in-time record of what was submitted and extracted.

---

## Integrity and immutability

Integrity controls are applied once OCR processing is complete:

- Artefacts are generated once per verification
- Hashes are calculated immediately after generation
- Records are treated as immutable

If a document is resubmitted, a new verification and audit pack is created

---

## What is intentionally not included

Passport OCR validation does not include:

- Biometric matching or liveness checks
- Cross-checking against government databases
- Determinations of right to work or legal status
- Reconstructed or enhanced document images

QuietLayer records what was submitted and extracted — nothing more.

---

## Data handling

Passport images and extracted data are handled in accordance with QuietLayer’s data handling and integrity principles:

- Data minimisation
- Purpose limitation
- Restricted access
- Configurable retention

Details are covered in the Data Handling & Integrity documentation.

---

## Responsibility and scope

Passport OCR validation supports identity verification workflows but does not replace employer judgment or legal obligations.

Final decisions about suitability, compliance, or employment remain the responsibility of the organisation performing the verification.

---

## Summary

QuietLayer’s passport OCR validation service provides:

- Consistent extraction of passport data,
- Clear validation boundaries,
- Auditable evidence of what was submitted, and
- durable records suitable for review.

It is designed to reduce manual effort while preserving traceability and trust.
