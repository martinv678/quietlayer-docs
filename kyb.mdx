title: "KYB Verification"

# 

## Purpose

QuietLayer’s KYB (Know Your Business) verification service provides a structured way to collect, validate, and evidence information about UK businesses.

The service is designed to:
- support business due diligence,
- reduce manual checks against public registers, and
- produce inspection-ready audit packs that document what was verified and when.

Each KYB verification represents a **single, point-in-time assessment** based on the data available at the time of the check.

---

## When KYB verification is used

KYB verification is typically used when:

- onboarding a business customer or partner,
- meeting regulatory or internal due diligence requirements,
- validating company details before entering a commercial relationship, or
- maintaining auditable records of business checks.

QuietLayer supports KYB as an evidence and audit layer, not as a legal or regulatory authority.

---

## Inputs

To perform a KYB verification, QuietLayer requires:

- Company identifier (e.g. Companies House number)
- Jurisdiction (currently UK)
- Organisational context (the organisation performing the verification)

No manual document uploads are required to initiate a standard KYB check.

---

## Verification process

For each KYB verification, QuietLayer performs the following steps:

1. Receives the company identifier  
2. Retrieves company data from authoritative public sources (e.g. Companies House)  
3. Validates and normalises returned data  
4. Records the retrieved information and verification timestamps  
5. Generates an audit pack documenting the verification  

The process captures **what was returned at the time of the check**, without enrichment or inference.

---

## Data retrieved

Depending on availability, KYB verification may include:

- Company name and registration number  
- Registered address  
- Company status (e.g. active, dissolved)  
- Incorporation date  
- Officers and directors  
- Persons with Significant Control (PSC), where available  

Returned data is recorded as received from the source.

---

## Verification outcome

Each KYB verification produces a clear outcome, including:

- Company identity details  
- Company status at the time of verification  
- Verification timestamp (UTC)  
- QuietLayer verification reference ID  

QuietLayer records factual data but does not make risk or suitability determinations.

---

## Audit pack generation

An audit pack is generated for every completed KYB verification.

The audit pack includes:

- A structured audit report (PDF)  
- Retrieved company data  
- Verification metadata and identifiers  
- Cryptographic integrity hashes (SHA-256)  

The audit pack represents a **durable snapshot** of the business information as it existed at the time of verification.

Further detail is available in the Audit Pack Specification.

---

## Integrity and immutability

Integrity controls are applied once the KYB verification is completed:

- Audit artefacts are generated once per verification  
- Cryptographic hashes are calculated immediately  
- Records are treated as immutable  

If a new KYB check is required, a new verification and audit pack must be created.  
Existing records are not modified or updated.

---

## What this service does not do

KYB verification does **not**:

- provide credit scoring or financial risk assessment  
- assert legal standing beyond returned public data  
- monitor companies continuously  
- replace internal compliance or legal review  

QuietLayer provides evidence, not judgement.

---

## Data handling

Data used during KYB verification is handled in accordance with QuietLayer’s data handling and integrity principles:

- data minimisation,  
- purpose limitation, and  
- restricted access.

Details are covered in the Data Handling & Integrity documentation.

---

## Responsibility and scope

QuietLayer supports KYB workflows by providing structured, auditable evidence of business checks.

Final responsibility for due diligence decisions and risk assessments remains with the organisation performing the verification.

---

## Summary

QuietLayer’s KYB verification service provides:

- automated retrieval of business information,  
- consistent evidence capture, and  
- audit-ready records suitable for review and inspection.

Each verification produces a clear, point-in-time record of what was checked and what was returned.
